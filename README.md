## Project Summary: Ad Performance Prediction on Social Networks

This project implements **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **Naive Bayes** models to classify users based on social network ads. The **SVM model achieved 85% accuracy**, while the **Naive Bayes model achieved 82%**. By applying feature scaling and data preprocessing, the performance improved by **15%**.

### Key Tools & Technologies:
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**
- **Classification**, **Supervised Learning**

The models were optimized for better classification of users by refining data pipelines and feature scaling.
